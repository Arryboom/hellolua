Hello, Lua!
===========

This project demonstrates integration of Lua into a C program.
Each file represents a single concept in a small, minimalistic
fashion, without a lot of unnecessary cruft that's not helpful
in demonstrating that one concept.

I created these as I was learning to integrate Lua into my own
project. It's focused primarily on having millions of coroutines
processing TCP connections, so will be more like the *OpenResty*
project (used in *nginx* and *CloudFlare*) rather than something
like *World of Warcraft*.
